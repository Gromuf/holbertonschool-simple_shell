# holbertonschool-simple_shell

## Appendix

We can read the original man page of bash shell here :

```bash
	man bash
```

we can compile the project using this command line in this way :

```bash
	gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```

you can run the project this way in interractive mode :

```bash
	./hsh
```

or in this way in non interractive mode (where command is a shell command as ls or pwd as exemple) :

```bash
	echo command | ./hsh
```

## Requirements :

All our files should end with a new line, with a maximum of 5 functions per file and 40 lines per function.
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## File list :

Here are the main project files :

### 01. `main.c`

This file is the final code to execute the simple shell.

### 02. `main.h`

The header file, it contains the declarations and prototypes of all our functions.

### 03. `1_getenv.c`

This file get the environnement variable.

### 04. `2_strtok_r.c`

This file is our rewritten strtok_r function.

### 05. `3_which.c`

This file contains the function as come as which. This function help to locate a command in the directories listed in PATH.

### 06. `4_exec_cmd.c`

This file contains function execute the command we write in our simple shell.

### 07. `5_exec_multiple_cmd.c`

This file is for multiple command given to the simple shell, it splits every of them and execute them one by one.

### 08. `6_handle_which_path.c`

Functions in this file are searching to check the absolute path, the current directory and the command in directorie listed in path.

### 09. `7-path.c`

Functions in this file are searching our written command in the PATH.

### 10. `8-string_functions.c`

Functions in this file are rewritten simple string functions.

### 11. `9-subfunction.c`

In this file we can find some little sub-function used to make the shell work correctly.

## Project goal :

In this project, we developed a simplified shell. It can execute commands by providing a direct path, such as `/bin/ls` or simply by entering a command like `ls` which it locates using the PATH environment variable. The shell operates in both interactive and non-interactive modes. It supports single-argument commands and can be closed using the exit command or the CTRL + C shortcut.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
	git clone https://github.com/Gromuf/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
	cd holbertonschool-simple_shell
```

## Compilation GCC :

```bash
	gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```

## Compilation whith Makefile:
script:
```bash
# Compiler name
CC = gcc

# Compilation options
CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

# Executable name
EXECUTABLE = hsh

# Source files (all .c files in the current directory)
SOURCES = $(wildcard *.c)

# Default target
all: $(EXECUTABLE)

# Rule to create the executable
$(EXECUTABLE): $(SOURCES)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(SOURCES) -o $(EXECUTABLE)

# Rule to clean generated files clean:
	rm -f $(EXECUTABLE)

# Rule to clean everything and rebuild the project
fclean: clean

# Rule to clean everything and rebuild the project
re: fclean all

# To not interfere with files in the directories
.PHONY: all clean fclean re
```

Command to compile the first time if executable hsh does not exist
```bash
	make
```
Command to compile the second time if executable hsh exist
```bash
	make re
```
